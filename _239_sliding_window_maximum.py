239. Sliding Window Maximum

Given an array nums,
A sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right.
You can only see the k numbers in the window.
Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

For example,
Given nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3.

Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
Therefore, return the max sliding window as [3,3,5,5,6,7].

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, ie: 1 ≤ k ≤ input array's size for non-empty array.

Follow up:
Could you solve it in linear time?

Hint:

How about using a data structure such as deque (double-ended queue)?
The queue size need not be the same as the window’s size.
Remove redundant elements and the queue should store only elements that need to be considered.
