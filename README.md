36 Valid Sudoku
Determine if a Sudoku is valid, according to: Sudoku Puzzles - The Rules.
The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.

136 Single Number
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory? 

137 Single Number II
Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

260 Single Number III
Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.
For example:  Given nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5], return [3, 5].
Note:
The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

258 Add Digit
Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
For example:  Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
Follow up:  Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime? 

263 Ugly Number
Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number. 

264 Ugly Number II
Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.
Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
