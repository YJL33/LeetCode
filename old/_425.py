Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you can build from them.

Note:

    There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
    All words will have the exact same length.
    Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
    Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.

Example 1:

Input:
["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]

Output:
[
  [ "wall",
    "area",
    "lead",
    "lady"
  ],
  [ "ball",
    "area",
    "lead",
    "lady"
  ]
]

Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).

Example 2:

Input:
["abat","baba","atan","atal"]

Output:
[
  [ "baba",
    "abat",
    "baba",
    "atan"
  ],
  [ "baba",
    "abat",
    "baba",
    "atal"
  ]
]
