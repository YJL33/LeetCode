115. Distinct Subsequences

Given a string S and a string T,
count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from
the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters
without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
(ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

Here is an example:
S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"

Return 3.
